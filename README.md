# ZeroNet launcher
### A simple way to launch ZeroNet on macOS

Many macOS users are confused how to launch ZeroNet, because you might need to use a terminal. Therefore I made this simple launcher.

##### how to launch ZeroNet with this launcher

  1. Download ZeroBundle-mac-osx.zip from the official site and unzip it.
  2. Drag the folder ZeroBundle to your /Applications folder
  3. Download `ZeroNet.command` from this repo and double click on it.
  4. A terminal window will appear for a second. When this says you can close it, close it.
  5. After some time the ZeroNet will launch in your main browser.
 

I hope this launcher will make it easy for you to launch ZeroNet!
